This whole VS_only folder is so that we can use VS to edit the libraries.

Rules:
    -Tell everyone what lib you are working on. Creating is fine but dont
    edit an existing one thats not yours, without consent. It will result
    with murge errors.

    -Dont Edit the stuff in VS_Only unless you get consent from kyle.
        Note: The only reason to edit this is if there is a funtion you
              want to use in arduino.h that has not been defined yet.

    -Please pull before and after you work on code. Back up work before
     you pull in the case of a conflit. this prevents your hard work from
     getting deleted.

    -Comment Code Please! Follow Doxygen rules for CSC classes.
